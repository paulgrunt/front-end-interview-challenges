/* 

Gotcha's when dealing with CSS selector specificity issues
  - The universal selector * has no specificity.
  - properties with !important are applied even if the selector is less specific.
  - …Except for the properties with !important in same or a higher specificity selectors later in your CSS.
  - …Except for the style="" attribute on an element.
  - If you use a pseudo class like :not() or :is(), the selector inside it with the highest specificity determines the specificity.
  - Anything in a :where() has no specificity.
  - For :nth-child() and :nth-last-child() pseudo-classes the specificity is the combination of the pseudo-class itself (0,1,0) plus the most specific of the selectors in them.
  - Child or sibling selectors (>, ~, +) add no specificity.
