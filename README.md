# front-end-interview-challenges
My collection of interview challenges, concepts and patterns.

## Resources I've used to level up and prep for front end techincals: 
- [Front End Interview Handbook](https://frontendinterviewhandbook.com/) - loads of pop-quiz style questions and lists of concepts to focus on
- [Tech Interview Handbook](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/) - great tips on studying algo/data structures and mastering the behavioral interview
- [Educative.io's Ace The Front End Interview](https://www.educative.io/path/ace-front-end-interview) - I went ahead and paid for access to this course, it's been hugely valuable and pushed me to implement many of the challenges in this repo
- [Leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com) - A great place to push yourself and find new challenges

### Articles that are helpful for getting started
- [3 Month Coding Interview Bootcamp](https://dev.to/fahimulhaq/3-month-coding-interview-bootcamp-5gpl) - written by the creator of Educative.io so it heavily suggests you signup for their site but still a good getting-started outline for making your study plan

Some of the directories or source files are empty as placeholders, they'll be filled as I get to them.
