#### Modified example inspired by the book Head First Design Patterns published by O'Reily

The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independantly from the clients that use it. 

Design principles: 
- `Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same`
- `Program to an interface, not an implementation`
- `Favor composition over inheritance`
